# About the project
I have choosen TMDb Movie Data for my Investigation in this project.

# What needs to be done
For the this project, I will conduct my own data analysis and create a file to share my findings. I will start by taking a look at the dataset and brainstorm what questions I could answer using it. Then i will use pandas and NumPy to answer the questions that I am most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers. I have not been required to use inferential statistics or machine learning to complete this project, but I will make it clear in my communications that my findings are tentative. This project is open-ended in that they aren't looking for one right answer.

# Why this project
In this project, I'll go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together. I'll use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier! Not only that, these are sought-after skills by employers!

# Requirements

This project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries installed:

    Python 3.6.5
    NumPy
    Pandas
    matplotlib
    seaborn

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.
